Caf√© Cat Caca
- A game where you can be a customer or an employee in our cafe!

/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow we so BOSS bc...
* we figured out why the dine and dash kept showing up even though the customer wasn't trying to dine and dash
* able to make a 2d array with the menu item and Price
* used parseInt to turn the strings from our menu into ints we can use
* adding invalid choices using a while loop
    * used while (choice != 1 && choice != 2) instead of while (choice != 1 || choice != 2) because || meant that any value that isn't 1 or isn't 2
      would work for the loop. So even if the user inputs 1 that would mean it "isn't 2" so the game would not proceed.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
blah blah pesky bug...
maybe some of these will move into the Obs.Ovrcm section...
* typing letters for the dine and dash game

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow! oo!...
* the animation to launch the game using Thread.sleep()
* learned to manipulate 2d ArrayList
* how to pause the program for a couple of seconds

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
we changed ___ to ___ bc...

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
tales of wisdom gained...
